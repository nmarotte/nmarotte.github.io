    <h1>Minimization and maximization</h1>
    <p>On this webpage, we will discuss on how we can find enumerate all the possible combination/configuration of the point <b>q</b> and the line <b>h</b>.
        We call a configuration the colour of the plane given the set of lines. That is the point <b>q</b>, the line <b>h</b>, and the colour of each intersection point and each line.</p>
    <p>A simple, brute-force, way to do this would be to simply fill the plane with <b>x</b> lines/points equally spaced by a small amount of pixels, and then compute the values <b>µ</b>.
        This approach wasn't chosen because we can easily do better.
    </p>
    <p>
        We can now ask ourselves : What count as two equivalent line/point placement ?
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer is as follows. Since the colour of a line only depends on the intersection points on that line,
        we notice that two configuration are equivalent if all the lines have the same colour. This means we can enumerate
        all the configuration by changing the colours of the lines from green to red and vice-versa for each line
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the colour of a line is defined only by its intersection point, and that the colour of an intersection changes
        once it enters or exits the half plane, we can say that by rotating the line <b>h</b> around the point q, we will enumerate all
        the possible configuration of the plane.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is explained by the fact that once the line <b>h</b> crosses over an intersection point, that point changes colour and by sweeping the line around the point <b>q</b>, we are guaranteed to hit every intersection.
        This is illustrated in Figure 1
    </p>


    <p>
        Knowing that, we can refine our sweeping by simply bouncing the line <b>h</b> around <b>q</b> from intersection to intersection so that each intersection changes region once.
        However it isn't sufficient to do it in only one order (clockwise for example), since the opposite configuration
        (swapping every green point for a red point and vice-versa) doesn't necessarily means that the colour of the lines will be swapped the same way. Therefore we need to also do it in counter-clockwise order.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice however it is easier to do by bouncing the line <b>h</b> around <b>q</b> using epsilons.
        We consider the line being slightly on the left of both points to simulate a clockwise order, then slightly on the right for the counter-clockwise order, and then starting on
        the left of <b>q</b> and ending on the right of the intersection and vice versa (this is necessary for at least the case where n is 3).
        This is demonstrated in the Figure 2 where the epsilons were exaggerated.
    </p>

    <p>
        This was for the theoretical part, but given our limited precision program, we uses epsilons with value 10^(-9) and since p5js isn't that much precise with point placing, we are sure that two points
        (except if they have exactly the same coordinate) will always be far enough so that the epsilon doesn't make the line cross over that close point. <br>
        To move the line <b>h</b> slightly to the right or the left of the line connecting <b>q</b> and an intersection point,
        we simply need to add epsilon to the two points defining the line <b>h</b>, and subtract epsilon to get the line on the other side
    </p>


    <h3>Minimizing µ for all the lines <b>h</b> in regards to a given point <b>q</b></h3>
    Now that we know how to enumerate all the possible configuration, we simply need to try them all and keep track of the line <b>h</b> for which there is a minimal number of green lines.
    In our implementation we obviously don't just look at the colour of the line in order to determine the value µ but we check if every point of that line is in the same region as <b>q</b> in regards to the line <b>h</b>
    <h3>Maximizing µ for all the points <b>q</b> with µ-minimizing line <b>h</b></h3>
