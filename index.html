  <h1>The center point for n lines</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The problem of finding the center point for n lines is as follows : Considering a set of n lines extending to infinity, a point <b>q</b> and a line <b>h</b>, there always exists one point such that, for any line <b>h</b> cutting the plane in two, we cannot find a half plane (defined by the point <b>q</b>) with less than <b>µ</b> "green lines".
  </p>

  <p>
    We call a green line, a line for which every intersection point is inside the region defined by <b>h</b> and <b>q</b>. Theorem 7 of <a href="#Dujmovic and Langerman (2010)">[1]</a> showed that the number of "green lines", <b>µ</b>, or in their paper μL(H) for the set of lines L in the half plane H is always greater or equal than the √(n/3) for n the number of lines.
  </p>

  <p>
    This proved lower bound means that we can always find a point <b>q</b> for which there exist no line <b>h</b> such that the number of "green lines" (or lines which pairwise intersect in that half plane) is smaller than √(n/3).
  </p>
  <h2>Divide and conquer</h2>

  <p>
    The problem can be divided in two parts : first, given the point <b>q</b>, we can look for all the different lines <b>h</b> to extract the line with the minimal <b>µ</b>, and finally, once we have that primitive, we can start to look for all the different points <b>q</b> to extract one point <b>q</b> with maximal µ. For any region of the plane defined by this point <b>q</b> and any line <b>h</b>, theorem 7 of <a href="#Dujmovic and Langerman (2010)">[1]</a> proved that µ cannot be less than √(n/3)

    Click <a href="explanation.html">here</a> or on the following button to access the detailed explanation page
    <button onclick="window.location.href='explanation.html'">Details of the implementation</button>
  </p>

  <h2>The program</h2>
  <p>On the right of this page you can find a gray area. This is the zone on which you can click to place lines, <b>q</b>, and <b>h</b>.</p>
  <p>
    <label for="n_mikado">This first button allows you to drop n lines on the canvas</label><input type="number" id="n_mikado" min="1" value="15"> <button onclick='drop_random_lines(document.getElementById("n_mikado").value);'>Mikado drop</button>
    Please use with precaution as the program will significantly start to slow down after approximately 100 lines.
  </p>

  <p>The following buttons allow you to place the point <b>q</b> either manually by clicking once on the canvas after pressing the button, or randomly by simply clicking the random button.</p>
  <button onclick="canvas.mouseClicked(click_q)">Place Q manually</button>
  <button onclick="click_q_random()">Place Q at random</button>
  <p>Click this button to draw the line <b>h</b> that will separate the plane in two halves. The region containing <b>q</b> will be called <b>H</b></p>
  <button onclick="canvas.mouseClicked(click_h)">Draw separator</button>
  <p>Click this button to find the best <b>h</b> for the given point <b>q</b> (number of green lines outputted in the console)</p>
  <button onclick="console.log(find_best_h());">Find best separator</button>
  <p>Click this button to find the best <b>q</b> in the canvas. This is a brute force method and will be <b>WAY TOO SLOW</b> for more than 15 lines, as this is still experimental (number of green lines outputted in the console)</p>
  <button onclick="console.log(find_best_q());">Find best point q</button>
  <br> <br> <br> <br>
  <p>Finally, this button allows you the reset the drawing, that is removing all the lines and points</p>
  <button onclick="setup()">Reset drawing</button>
  <p>This button saves the current canvas on the computer</p>
  <button onclick="saveCanvas(canvas, 'canvas', 'jpg');">Save canvas</button>
