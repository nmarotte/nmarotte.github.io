  <h1>The center point for n lines</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The problem of finding the center point for n lines is as follows : Considering a set of n lines extending to infinity, a point <b>q</b> and a line <b>h</b>, there always exists one point such that, for any line <b>h</b> cutting the plane in two, we cannot find a half plane (defined by the point <b>q</b>) with less than <b>µ</b> "green lines".
  </p>

  <p>
    Considering n lines and starting with 0 green lines (The subset L(H) is empty). For each line, we will color it green (add it to the subset L(H)) if and only if all its intersection with all the green lines are inside the region H. Theorem 7 of <a href="#Dujmovic and Langerman (2010)">[1]</a> showed that the number of "green lines", <b>µ</b>, or in their paper μL(H) for the set of lines L in the half plane H is always greater or equal than the √(n/3) for n the number of lines.
  </p>

  <p>
    This proved lower bound means that we can always find a point <b>q</b> for which there exist no line <b>h</b> such that the number of "green lines" (or lines which pairwise intersect in that half plane) is smaller than √(n/3).
  </p>
  <h2>Divide and conquer</h2>

  <p>
    The problem can be divided in two parts : first, given the point <b>q</b>, we can look for all the different lines <b>h</b> to extract the line with the minimal <b>µ</b>, and finally, once we have that primitive, we can start to look for all the different points <b>q</b> to extract one point <b>q</b> with maximal µ. For any region of the plane defined by this point <b>q</b> and any line <b>h</b>, theorem 7 of <a href="#Dujmovic and Langerman (2010)">[1]</a> proved that µ cannot be less than √(n/3)

    Click <a href="explanation.html">here</a> or on the following button to access the detailed explanation page
    <button onclick="window.location.href='explanation.html'">Details of the implementation</button>
  </p>

  <h2>The program</h2>
  <p>On the right of this page you can find a gray area. This is the zone on which you can click to place lines, <b>q</b>, and <b>h</b>.</p>
  <p>
    <label for="n_mikado">This first button allows you to drop n lines on the canvas</label><input type="number" id="n_mikado" min="1" value="15"> <button onclick='drop_random_lines(document.getElementById("n_mikado").value);'>Mikado drop</button>
    Please use with precaution as the program will significantly start to slow down after approximately 100 lines.
  </p>

  <p>The following buttons allow you to place the point <b>q</b> either manually by clicking once on the canvas after pressing the button, or randomly by simply clicking the random button.</p>
  <button onclick="canvas.mouseClicked(click_q)">Place Q manually</button>
  <button onclick="click_q_random()">Place Q at random</button>
  <p>Click this button to draw the line <b>h</b> that will separate the plane in two halves. The region containing <b>q</b> will be called <b>H</b></p>
  <button onclick="canvas.mouseClicked(click_h)">Draw separator</button>
  <p>Click this button to find the best <b>h</b> for the given point <b>q</b> (number of green lines outputted in the console)</p>
  <button onclick="find_best_h();">Find best separator</button>
  <p>Click this button to find the best <b>q</b> in the canvas. This is a brute force method and will be <b>WAY TOO SLOW</b> for more than 15 lines, as this is still experimental (number of green lines outputted in the console)</p>
  <button onclick="console.log(find_best_q());">Find best point q</button>
  <h3>Performances</h3>
  <button onclick="show_intersections=!show_intersections">Toggle drawing of intersections</button>
  <h3>Hand free</h3>
  <label for="nb_lines_goal">Input the maximal number of lines you wish to test (Recommended for less than 1mn run : 9 ) </label><input type="number" id="nb_lines_goal" value="9"><button onclick="clicked_walkthrough()">Click this button to see the program in action (Adds 3 lines, then 1 line at a time and find the best q until it has enough lines).</button>
  <br> <br> <br> <br>
  <p>Finally, this button allows you the reset the drawing, that is removing all the lines and points</p>
  <button onclick="setup()">Reset drawing</button>
  <p>This button saves the current canvas on the computer</p>
  <button onclick="saveCanvas(canvas, 'canvas', 'jpg');">Save canvas</button>
